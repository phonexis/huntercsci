when naming repos, avoid using special characters

The hard part is collecting data with meaningful results

Question answering system (example: google) is just statistics and data

There's no intelligence of this data collected (are you gonna do it based on what is searched the most or what appears in the most searches?)

people generally work backwards to find their errors to debug their own program
what you'd do for other people is to read from the beginning as opposed to starting in the middle

The important thing is what things can you do to help you find the answer:
    One thing you can do is insert debug print statements but you need to have a some sort of marker to distinguish what lines are for debugging purposes.
    Another thing you can do is 

cout is buffered(memory builds up)
cerr is a separate ouput stream that goes to console and it's not buffered. You can redirect the output because sometimes you dont want to pollute your cout

ctrl xa (???? for what)

postmortem programming

if it is a memory related issue, it'll dictate when the error will or won't occur
