features for a laptop may be storage, memory, size, resolution, color, weight, o/s [all of these should be scaled to 0.0-1.0 or 1-100] (you want to change them such that they can be graphed meaningfully. you wants these to be scaled in a way such that they mean the same thing)

distance formula can go to any dimensions. In math, we call a point a vectors(an array with two elements). A (x,y) point is a vector on 2 dimensions and (x,y,z) is a vecotr on 3 dimensions.
If we have two vectors a and b in n dimensions, you can basically have the distance formula become the sqrt(sum from i=0 to n of (a[i]-b[i])^2).

A recommendations system is just a glorified distance formula.

Lab is going to be graded based on how much you've completed & pair programming

Letters follow certain frequencies and it turns out that in a typical sentence there are relative frequencies for letters. 

You're gonna want to write a distance formula that returns the distance between two vectors.

structure of decoder:
input: a string that's been encoded
[sub goal labeling]
calculate the frequency vector for the input
	  EX:
		 input:"aabccccdef"
			[.2,.1,.3,.1,.1,.1,0,0,0,0,.. to 26 places]
			  a  b  c  d  e  f g h i j ...
you're going to want to loop over all 26 rotations
       loop i from 0 to 26
       r = encode(input,i)
       calculate r's frequency vector -> fv
       find the distance between fv and freq

double distance(double a[26], double b[26]){
       return 0.0
}
