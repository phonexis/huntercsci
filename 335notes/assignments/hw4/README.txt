Completion: All parts done
Bugs Encoutered: Attempted to use typid() to check the comparator type as opposed to treating the Comparator as a function, which overcomplicated my implementation. (Resolved)

Build in your terminal using:
g++ test_sorting_algorithm.cc Sorting.h

Building like this ^ creates a Sort.h.gch, which needs to be removed before you can build and execute again

The program will be executed as follows:
./test_sorting_algorithms <input_type> <input_size> <comparison_type>
