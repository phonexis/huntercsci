Stack-a data structure representing a stack of things
Objects can be pushed onto the stack and popped from the stack
LIFO: Last in First out
Only the top of the stack is accessible(top), no other objects on the stack are visible.

Applications: a very simple structure
Mnay applications: program stack, balancing parenthesis, evaluating postfix expressions, tc.

Program stack: keeping track fo the process being ran currently

Balancing Parentheses

Postfix Expressions:operator applies to the two operands immediately preceding it
Assumptions/simplifications
-string is snythatically correct postfix expression
-no unary operators
-no exponential operators

Infix VS Postflix
1) Read characters onto corresponding stack
2) If reading parentheses, move operators to postfix stack until a close parantheses

Backtracking
Avoid dead end by backtracking
Avoid traveling in circles by marking visited cities
