Recursion: you need a base case to stop adn you need to be moving towards that base case

SIMPLE TEMPLATE OF RECURSION
if(problem is sufficiently simple){
directly solve the problem
do something/return the solution
}
else{
split the prolem up into one or more smaller problems with the same structer as the original
solve some or all of those smaller problems
do something or combine results to return solution if necessary

void writeBackwards(std::string s){
siz_t length=s.size();
if(s>length){
std::cout << s.substr(length-1,1);
writeBackwards(s.substr(0,length-1));
}
}
