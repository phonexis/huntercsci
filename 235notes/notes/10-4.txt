POLYMORPHISM

upcasting: derived to base-automatically available through inheritance
downcasting: base to derived

static_cast checks at compile time that cast "makes sense"
Allows: converting between primitive types like int or float and converting pointers or references of Dervied type to pointers ore references of Base type (ex: Derived* and Base*) when target is at least as const as the source. As well as, converting pointers or references of Base type to pointers or references of Derived type (ex: Base* and Derived*) where target is at least as const as the source

dynamic_cast : If Base* did not point to Derived object, static_cast would succeed   e.g. access Derived data members not present in Base
