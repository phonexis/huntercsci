Queue: A data structure representing a waiting line
Objects can be enqueued to the back of the line or dequeued from the front of the line
FIFO: First in First out
Only front of the queue is accessible (front), no other objects in the queue are visible.

Queue Applications
Generating all substrings
Recognizing Palindromes

ANy waiting queues: print jobs, OS scheduling processes with equal priority

Generating all substrings
Generate all possible strings up to some fixed length n with repetition (same character included multiple times)
We saw how to do something similar recursively (generate permutations 

Breadth-First Search
Applications
	find first shortest path in graph
	GPS navigation systems
	Crawlers in search engines
	---
Generally good when looking for the shortest of best way to do something => lists things in increasing oreder of "size" stopping at the "shortest" solution

ANALYSIS
Finding all substrings (with repetition) of size up to n
Assume alphabet (A, B, ... , Z) of size 26
The empty string = 1
All strings of size 1 = 26
Al string of size 2 = 26^2
...
All strings of size n = 26^n

Take one string out and loop -> repeat till there's nothing in the queue
The loop is looping the number of times the string is being added to the queue
The # of string being added is above ^ 26, 26^2, ... ,26^n
26^0 + 26^1 + 26^2 + ... + 26^n
O(26^n)
