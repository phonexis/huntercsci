Dynamic memory allocation

COPY CONSTRUCTOR:
1)Initialize one object from another of the same type
	     MyClass one;
	     MyClass two = one; //make a copy of it when you instantiate two
	     	     OR
	     MyClass one;
	     MyClass two(one); //Identical to the example above
2)Copy an object to pass by value as an argument to a function
       void MyFunction(MyClass arg){ //you're not passing a value, you're making a copy

       }
3)Copy and object to be returned by a function
       MyClass MyFunction(){
       	    MyClass mc;
	    return mc;
       }

Deep vs Shallow Copy:
The Shallow Copy would be like having two bags, one being a copy of a bag. However it isn't independent like a deep copy because it would share only the item count and headptr
    Deep Copy: Would copy the linked chain with a new chain ptr.

Overloaded Operator=
	   MyClass one;
	   //Stuff here
	   MyClass two=one;
	   	   IS DIFFERENT FROM:
 	   MyClass one;
	   //Stuff here
	   two=one;
