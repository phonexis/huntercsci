Node- chains of an item followed by a pointer to the next item

getNext() will return the data member pointing to the next node

Instantiate a new node and let a temp pointer point to it
Let the next pointer of the new node point to the same node head_ptr_ points to
Let head_ptr_ point to the new node
temp_ptr=new node
temp_ptr->next=head_ptr_ 
head_ptr_=temp_ptr
temp_ptr=nullptr

Traversing the Chain:
let a current pointer point to the first node in the chain
whil(the current pointer is not the null pointer){
"visit" the current node
set the current pointer to the next pointer of the current node
}

Similarly getFrequencyof will traverse the chain and count frequency of an_entry

Efficiency: no fixed number of steps; depends on location of an entry (you have to look at every node)

WHAT SHOULD WE DO TO REMOVE?
