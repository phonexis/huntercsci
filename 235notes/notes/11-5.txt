Stack is an abstract data type that allows you to only look at the top of the stack.
ADT is the logical/abstract description of the organization and operations on the data

Data structure is the representtion/implmentatio of the ADT

We may have multiple implementation of the ADT

To complicate matters, a data structure may be implemented using other data structures
-stack implementation using vecotr
priority quenue implemented using heap

If main() instantiates a stack, it is using a stack data structure, no matter which implementation we choose.
