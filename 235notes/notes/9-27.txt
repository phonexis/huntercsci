Abstract Class

Polymorphism-occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance
ex:
Base{ someMethod(); };
Derivec{ someMethod() override };

main(){
Base* base_ptr = new Base;
Base* derived_ptr = new Derived;
//stuff here


virtual function does have to be pure
Superclass need not be abstract
Late binding/dynamic binding refers to what normally happens when the virtual keyword is used in a method's declaration. C++ then creates a so-called virtual table, which is a look-up table for such functions that will always be consulted when they are called.

pure virtual: we don't apply implementation to make it abstract
virtual: the base class is not abstract anymore

we only use override, virtual, or =0 in the class interface 
When using pointers to base class, to let derived classes override functions in base class must make the base class's function virtual

We can disallow in an inheritance chain:
final specifier prevents inheritance and prevents deriving classes from overriding methods

runtime costs of virtual functions:
C++ maintinas virtual function tables that store pointers to each virtual function. Determine which function to call at execution time by looking up v-table of object being pointed to -> slower & extra space for v-tables

Overhead->mark individual functions virtual to take advantage of polymorphism only when appropriate
Fully polymorphic inheritance would be overkill in most cases
