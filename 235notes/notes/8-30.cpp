//Abstraction and OOP(Object Oriented Programming)
/*
Encapsualtion-objects combine data and operations:
class SomeClass{
//access specifier which can be private, public, or protected
//data members and member functions
};

A user-defied data type that bundles  together data and operations on the data.

Information Hiding- objects hide inner details:
From now on, everytime you design a class, you will be separating the interface with implementation.

Data members:the attributes/data
Member funcitons: the operations/actions availabe on the data
 -Mutator functions: modify the data members
 -Accessor fuctnions: retrieve the value of data members (using const)
 -Constructor
 -Destructor

Class:type (like int)
Object:instance of the class
